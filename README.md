<p id="description">Commercial tenders are very similar to government tenders. They require just as much attention to detail. Usually a tender application is submitted on paper and it contains many numbers that must be checked for accuracy. If several contractors participate in the tender for a project the general contractor is forced to deal with all the documentation which can include hundreds of pages. We wanted to offer clients a platform for online tenders giving them the opportunity to digitise the entire process and reduce the amount of time spent on tenders. Instead of dealing with tons of printouts and literally running around from department to department clients would be able to electronically submit tenders utilize a database of contractors with access control and receive and manage bids right on the website.</p>
